# WTF is a Twitterbot?

> A Twitterbot is an **autonomous software agent** that generates its own textual outputs, to reflect its own interests and domain of knowledge, and tweets these outputs without human control or curation. 

### Is it creative?

> [...] Almost all Twitterbots are merely **generative**, insofar as they generate outputs that are sometimes taken to be witty, apt or even creative by their recipients, but many more besides. Mere generators are unable to critique their own outputs, and predict which have creative merit and which do not. Twitterbots are playful and subversive creations, and the very best allow their developers to be meta-creative conceptual artists.

## Botiquette

Adapted from [Darius Kazemi's](http://tinysubversions.com/2013/03/basic-twitter-bot-etiquette/)

1. Don’t @mention people who haven’t opted in.
* Don’t follow Twitter users who haven’t opted in
* Don’t use a pre-existing hashtag. Using an existing hashtag, particularly a trending hashtag, is what Twitter refers to as `hashtag pollution`
* Don’t go over your rate limits















# Very MISC

Twitter estimates that 1/20 of its accounts is not human (see [Bot or Not?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00975))

Aesthetics: Lots of bots focus on quantity over quality (to some degree). There’s an element of serendipity to
following bots and discovering tweets. For (some) Twitterbots, the volume of tweets and scarcity of truly surprising and great tweets are aesthetics (eg: @everyword).

For Computational Creativity, the ratio of good tweets to all tweets is more important. We call this ratio the
curation coefficient

> Most bots play dice
