# Can computers make art?

Or more specifically...

> Can computer algorithms generate art?

Of course! We could argue that computers don't know (yet) they have generated something worthy of being considered art. 

<!-- Computer programs lack self-awareness (at present), and for the sake of this workshop, they lack what is called *curation coefficient*: they don't know if what they generated is good. --> 

The question is **not whether** or not art can be made using algorithms, **but how**.

### The Infinite Monkey theorem

> Given enough time, a hypothetical monkey typing at **random** would, as part of its output, almost surely produce all of Shakespeareâ€™s plays.

Let's not try this with real monkeys! Instead we can (quite easily) create a computer program that simulates the theorem's hypothetical monkey. We can instruct our algorithmic monkey to *play dice* and combine sets of symbols to compose words, words to make sentences and so on.

### Since we don't have enough time...

What's the likelihood of getting a meaningful sentence out of a completely random combination of words? It depends ... in any case it's *very* low.

How do we train our algorithmic monkey to hit meaningful sentences more often?

1. With statistical probability, ie: a [**Markov chain**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). We can feed the monkey with source material (eg: an article, a poem, or an entire book) and teach it to notice which words are more likely to follow each word in the source text. Then we can ask the monkey to build chains of words that are likely to follow each other. 

	Spam bots often use Markov chains to generate semi-sensical texts (see [Spam Poetry](http://www.spampoetry.org). A fascinating example of Markov chains used on social media is [What would I say?](http://what-would-i-say.com)
* Using a **generative grammar**, ie: a set of rules that can generate combinations of words which form grammatical sentences. 
	
	We are familiar with the idea of *grammar* as a set of rules that define how we combine words in the languages we use to speak every day, so that other humans can understand us. 
	
	In a similar way, we can define a grammar for generative art. People have used generative grammars to make things like the [Art Critique generator](http://www.pixmaven.com/phrase_generator.html), the [Artist Bio generator](http://500letters.org/form_15.php), the [Fifty Shades generator](http://www.fiftyshadesgenerator.com/) and many other *generators*.
	
	A generative grammar is made of a set of **structural rules**, which tell the computer how to put text together, and a set of **expansions**, which are options the computer can pick when generating text. 
	
	Today we're using [Tracery](http://www.crystalcodepalace.com/tracery.html), a language specifically written to help you write those generative grammar rules.
	
# TODO

- [ ] Let's play a generative grammar together, eg: generative drawing with 3 random colours, 3 random starting points, 3 actions / shapes (could use Sol Levitt as inspiration)

- [ ] Let's get inspired. Show bots that are built using a generative grammar (Tracery + CBDQ) and think about what could be their grammar

- [ ] let's generate some ideas. Brain-swarming (or) bot idea generator

- [ ] Make the thing on CBDQ, with a little help from [this friend](https://matteomenapace.github.io/random-generator-generator/)
