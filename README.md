# Making bots that make art

Can a computer make art? Sure. Can you make art with a computer? Absolutely! Even if you (think you) have never written code before.

In this practical workshop you will learn how to make a bot that tweets your generative art. 

We will use [CheapBotsDoneQuick](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com), a tool that does the heavy lifting (Twitter API and such) so that we can focus on being creative with language and graphics.

### Why?

2016 was [announced to be the year of bots](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-2016-is-shaping-up-to-be-the-year-of-the-bot). As people move from social networks to messaging apps, companies increasingly hijack human conversations with *conversational interfaces*. There are weather bots, news bots, grocery bots, scheduling bots…

This is an opportunity for us to play with the language of bots, to develop a better understanding of how their generative grammars work, and to think critically about their impact on our own language.

### The plan

1. ICE-BREAKING

	In small teams, we will explore ideas around generative art by having one of us play the computer, and the rest of the team writing rules (aka algorithms) for her to perform. 
2. BRAIN-SWARMING

	We’ll get inspired with a few examples of generative-art-bots. Then we will generate ideas for your bot in a collective *brainswarm*: write down the inception of your idea, then pass it around the room for everyone else to add to it, until it comes back to you.
3. BOT-MAKING 

	We’ll help you turn your idea into a Twitter bot using CheapBotsDoneQuick. Before time is over, we’ll admire what you have produced and follow each other’s bot!
